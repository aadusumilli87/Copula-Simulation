# Copula-Simulation
Simulated 256 scenarios of 10 day changes in four financial assets: S&amp;P 500, VIX, Oil Prices (WTI), and Gold Prices, using a Vine Copula to capture the dependencies between the assets. The Vine Copula was parameterized with the log differences of the financial assets to avoid issues with non-stationarity and autocorrelation. Each draw from the Copula is therefore a set of 4 percent change values in the uniform scale, one for each asset. Since the Copula simulations are in the uniform scale, they must be scaled back using the marginal distributions of each asset. Visual inspection showed that the distribution of returns for each asset was symmetric but long tailed. As such, I chose a T-distribution with low degrees of freedom for the marignals. The 4 respective T-distributions were parameterized using the 'fitdistr' optimzation routine found in the 'MASS' R package. Ten day changes are calculated by taking the most recent closing price and chaining it through a given group of 10 scaled copula draws, subdived from 2,560 overall draws. Essentially, 2,560 overall draws were demarcated into 256 groups of 10 observations. The most recent closing price for each asset was chained through each set of 10 observations in a recursive approach, like so: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=P_t&space;=&space;P_{t-1}&space;*&space;(1&space;&plus;&space;R_t)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_t&space;=&space;P_{t-1}&space;*&space;(1&space;&plus;&space;R_t)" title="P_t = P_{t-1} * (1 + R_t)" /></a>, where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=P_t" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_t" title="P_t" /></a> denotes the asset price at time <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=t" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t" title="t" /></a> and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=R_t" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R_t" title="R_t" /></a> denotes the daily return of time <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=t" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t" title="t" /></a>. The simulated 10 day change is then simply the difference of the calculated price after applying the 10 daily changes and the initial closing price.
