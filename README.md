# Copula-Simulation
Simulated 256 scenarios of 10 day changes in four financial assets: S&amp;P 500, VIX, Oil Prices (WTI), and Gold Prices, using a Vine Copula to capture the dependencies between the assets. The Copula was parameterized with the log differences of the financial assets to avoid issues with non-stationarity and autocorrelation. Each draw from the Copula is therefore a percent change from the prior day price. Ten day changes are calculated by taking the most recent closing price and chaining it through a given group of 10 copula draws, subdived from 2,560 overall draws. Essentially, 2,560 overall draws were demarcated into 256 groups of 10 observations. The most recent closing price for each asset was chained through each set of 10 observations in a recursive approach, like so: <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=P_t&space;=&space;P_{t-1}&space;*&space;(1&space;&plus;&space;R_t)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_t&space;=&space;P_{t-1}&space;*&space;(1&space;&plus;&space;R_t)" title="P_t = P_{t-1} * (1 + R_t)" /></a>, where $P_t$ denotes the asset price at time $t$ and $R_t$ denotes the daily return of time $t$. The simulated 10 day change is then simply the difference of calculated price after 10 days and the initial closing price.
